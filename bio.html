 <h4>
     Hello, dear visitor.<p>
     I'm Ksenia.<p>
      I was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia. As a professional bass player I was touring Europe and Russia for about 10 years. 
      At the same time received a degree in Public Relations. 
      I have reached my goals back at home and decided to change my life, that's how I ended up being at Berklee. 
      I graduated in Summer 2021 with double major degree: Electronic Production, Design and Performance. <p></h4>
        <h4>
     I have 2 favorite states - being an investigator and being a creator.<p>
    The investigator in me loves to travel, to be outside the comfort zone and to collect impressions and experiences. I love extremes - from hitchhiking and sleeping on the streets to staying in 5 star hotels and playing music for the presidents. I'm always starving to fill my imaginary list with new impressions.<p>
    The other part of myself is tormented by the desire to invent something. And my Berklee experience happened to be a turning point. I used musical instruments before. Now I want to invent instruments, and Berklee gave me resources for being able to do that.<p>
    These two states for me are lovebirds. The more experiences I have in my bag, the more inspiration and imagination I have for creating and inventing.
   </h4> <p>
     
    <h4>
        
        Looking forward to new amazing oportunities. <p>
        Making this website.<p>
        Keeping my mind and heart open.
